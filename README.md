# [<img src="https://ipinfo.io/static/ipinfo-small.svg" alt="IPinfo" width="24"/>](https://ipinfo.io/) IPinfo NodeJS Client Library

This is the official NodeJS client library for the [IPinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io) IP data API, allowing you to look up your own IP address, or get any of the following details for an IP:

- [IP geolocation data](https://ipinfo.io/ip-geolocation-api) (city, region, country, postal code, latitude, and longitude)
- [ASN details](https://ipinfo.io/asn-api) (ISP or network operator, associated domain name, and type, such as business, hosting, or company)
- [Company data](https://ipinfo.io/ip-company-api) (the name and domain of the business that uses the IP address)
- [Carrier information](https://ipinfo.io/ip-carrier-api) (the name of the mobile carrier and MNC and MCC for that carrier if the IP is used exclusively for mobile traffic)

Check all the data we have for your IP address [here](https://ipinfo.io/what-is-my-ip).

**Works with ES5, ES6+ and TypeScript.**

## Getting Started

You'll need an IPinfo API access token, which you can get by signing up for a free account at [https://ipinfo.io/signup](https://ipinfo.io/signup).

The free plan is limited to 50,000 requests per month, and doesn't include some of the data fields such as IP type and company data. To enable all the data fields and additional request volumes see [https://ipinfo.io/pricing](https://ipinfo.io/pricing).

### Installation

#### npm

```bash
npm install node-ipinfo
```

#### yarn

```bash
yarn add node-ipinfo
```

### Usage

1. Initialize an instance of `IPinfoWrapper` with [your token](https://ipinfo.io/account/token).

```typescript
const { IPinfoWrapper } = require("node-ipinfo");

const ipinfoWrapper = new IPinfoWrapper("MY_TOKEN");
```

> [!TIP]
> If you are using ESM instead of CommonJS you can use `import`.
> ```
> import { IPinfoWrapper } from "node-ipinfo";
> ```

2. Perform a lookup for an IP address or ASN.

```typescript
const ipinfo = await ipinfoWrapper.lookupIp("1.1.1.1");
```

<details><summary>Standalone example</summary>

1. Create `ipinfo.js` with the following code, then replace `MY_TOKEN` with 
[your token](https://ipinfo.io/account/token).

```typescript
const { IPinfoWrapper } = require("node-ipinfo");

const ipinfoWrapper = new IPinfoWrapper("MY_TOKEN");

const ipAddress = process.argv[2] || "1.1.1.1";

ipinfoWrapper.lookupIp(ipAddress).then((ipinfo) => console.log(ipinfo));
```

2. Run `ipinfo.js` (without an IP) to lookup 1.1.1.1.

```shell
node ipinfo.js
{
  ip: '1.1.1.1',
  // ...
```

3. Run `ipinfo.js` with an IP to lookup, like `2.2.2.2` `8.8.8.8` or 
[your IP](https://ipinfo.io/what-is-my-ip).

```shell
node ipinfo.js 2.2.2.2
{
  ip: '2.2.2.2',
  // ...
```

</details>

#### Best practices

Each `lookup` method will throw an error when the lookup does not complete
successfully. A program that performs a lookup should catch errors unless it is
desirable for the error to bubble up. For example, if your program is performing 
a lookup to find the country code of an IP you can return "N/A" when catching an
error.

```typescript
const countryCode = ipinfoWrapper
    .lookupIp("1.1.1.1")
    .then((ipinfo) => ipinfo.countryCode)
    .catch((error) => "N/A");
```

### Caching

This library uses an LRU cache (deletes the least-recently-used items).

If you prefer a different caching methodology, you may use the `IPCache` interface through TypeScript and implement your own caching system around your own infrastructure.

The default cache length is 1 day and the default max number of items allowed in the cache is 5000. This can be changed by passing an `Option` to the `LruCache` constructor.

```typescript
const { IPinfoWrapper, LruCache } = require("node-ipinfo");

const cacheOptions = {
    max: 5000,
    ttl: 24 * 1000 * 60 * 60
};

const cache = new LruCache(cacheOptions);

const ipinfoWrapper = new IPinfoWrapper("MY_TOKEN", cache);
```

### Timeouts

The client constructor accepts a `timeout` parameter in milliseconds that
controls the timeout of requests. It defaults to `5000` i.e. 5 seconds.

A timeout of `0` disables the timeout feature.

```typescript
const { IPinfoWrapper } = require("node-ipinfo");

const timeout = 10 * 1000; // 10 seconds

const ipinfoWrapper = new IPinfoWrapper("MY_TOKEN", undefined, timeout);
```

### Internationalization

When looking up an IP address, the response object includes `response.country` will return the country name, `response.countryCode` can be used to fetch the country code, Additionally `response.isEU` will return `true` if the country is a member of the European Union (EU), `response.countryFlag` will return the emoji and Unicode of the country's flag, `response.countryFlagURL` will return a public link to the country's flag image as an SVG which can be used anywhere, `response.countryCurrency` will return the code and symbol of the country's currency and `response.continent` will return the continent of the IP. It is possible to return the country name in other languages, change the EU countries, countries flags, countries currencies, and continents by setting the `countries`, `euCountries`, `countriesFlags`, `countriesCurrencies` and `continents` settings when creating the IPinfo object.

```typescript
const { IPinfoWrapper } = require("node-ipinfo");

const internationalization = {
    countries: {
        US: "United States",
        FR: "France",
        BD: "Bangladesh"
        // ...
    },
    countriesFlags: {
        US: { emoji: "ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸", unicode: "U+1F1FA U+1F1F8" },
        AD: { emoji: "ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡©", unicode: "U+1F1E6 U+1F1E9" },
        AE: { emoji: "ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡ª", unicode: "U+1F1E6 U+1F1EA" }
        // ...
    },
    countriesCurrencies: {
        US: { code: "USD", symbol: "$" },
        AD: { code: "EUR", symbol: "â‚¬" },
        AE: { code: "AED", symbol: "Ø¯.Ø¥" }
        // ...
    },
    continents: {
        US: { code: "NA", name: "North America" },
        BD: { code: "AS", name: "Asia" },
        BE: { code: "EU", name: "Europe" }
        // ...
    },
    euCountries: ["FR", "ES", "BE"]
};

const ipinfoWrapper = new IPinfoWrapper(
    "MY_TOKEN",
    undefined,
    undefined,
    internationalization
);

ipinfoWrapper.lookupIp("8.8.8.8").then((response) => console.log(response));
```

```
{
  ip: "8.8.8.8",
  // ...
  countryCode: 'US',
  countryFlag: { emoji: 'ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸', unicode: 'U+1F1FA U+1F1F8' },
  countryFlagURL: 'https://cdn.ipinfo.io/static/images/countries-flags/US.svg',
  countryCurrency: { code: 'USD', symbol: '$' },
  continent: { code: 'NA', name: 'North America' },
  isEU: false
}
```

### Location Information

`response.loc` will return a composite string of latitude and longitude values in the `"latitude,longitude"` format.

```typescript
const { IPinfoWrapper } = require("node-ipinfo");

const ipinfoWrapper = new IPinfoWrapper("MY_TOKEN");

ipinfoWrapper.lookupIp("1.1.1.1").then(response => {
    // '34.0522,-118.2437'
    console.log(response.loc);
});
```

### Locate IPs on a World Map

A world map can be generated with locations of all input IPs using `getMap`. It returns the URL of the map in the response.

```typescript
const { IPinfoWrapper } = require("node-ipinfo");

const ipinfoWrapper = new IPinfoWrapper("MY_TOKEN");

const ips = ["1.1.1.1", "8.8.8.8", "1.2.3.4"]; 
ipinfoWrapper.getMap(ips).then(response => {
    console.log(response);
});
```

### Batch Operations

Looking up a single IP at a time can be slow. It could be done concurrently from the client side, but IPinfo supports a batch endpoint to allow you to group together IPs and let us handle retrieving details for them in bulk for you.

```typescript
const { IPinfoWrapper } = require("node-ipinfo");

const ipinfoWrapper = new IPinfoWrapper("MY_TOKEN");

const ips = ["1.1.1.1", "8.8.8.8", "1.2.3.4/country"]; 

ipinfoWrapper
    .getBatch(ips)
    .then(batch => console.log(batch));
```

The input size is not limited, as the interface will chunk operations for you
behind the scenes.

Please see [the official documentation](https://ipinfo.io/developers/batch) for
more information and limitations.
